# Todo List (ReactJS) + Amazon AWS Amplify

The source of course: https://aws.amazon.com/pt/getting-started/hands-on/build-react-app-amplify-graphql/?e=gs2020&p=frontend

In this tutorial, I created a simple web application using AWS Amplify, a set of tools and services that includes a web hosting service. In the first module, was created and host a React application on AWS. In the remaining 4 modules, and i launched a local application using the CLI, added authentication, added a GraphQL API and database, and update the application to store images. :)
